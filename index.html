  <div id="intro">
    <p>Resources for the 'Picnic Protectors' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will design and code a micro:bit alarm system.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Jun22CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#extensions">click here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Python Beta Editor</h3>
    <p>Open the new Python editor by visiting <a href="https://python.microbit.org/v/beta" target="_blank">python.microbit.org/v/beta</a>. Your screen will look something like this:</p>
    <img src=".\images\python-editor.PNG" alt="screenshot of the Python editor screen" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>On the right-hand-side is where you will add your own code.</li>
      <li>On the left-hand-side is the reference menu - you can see examples of some of the code here, as well as help understanding these examples.</li>
      <li>On the bottom are the Flash (send your code to the micro:bit) and Disconnect buttons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="pairing-python.html" target=_blank>If you see 'Download' and 'Connect' at the bottom of the screen instrad, follow these instructions to pair your micro:bit with your computer.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Edit the code on the screen, then flash it to your micro:bit to see the changes.</p>
    <p>Try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the image that is shown (hint: check the reference menu, under Display, for a list of images)</li>
        <li>Changing the number in the brackets after sleep (hint: this tells the micro:bit how long to keep your image on the display)</li>
        <li>Making the micro:bit scroll your name instead of 'Hello'</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="accelerometer" class="left">
    <h3>Using the motion sensor</h3>
    <p>You can find the accelerometer code by looking in the Reference menu for 'Accelerometer'.</p>
    <p>The code you are shown includes another<code> while True </code> loop, so we should not drag-and-drop the whole snippet into our current code.</p>
    <p>Unlike in Scratch, where you can have lots of forever loops all running at the same time, we can only use one main loop at once in Python - <strong>if you put another<code> while True </code> loop underneath the first one, this code will never happen, because the micro:bit is too busy doing the first loop!</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>To use the accelerometer, we use an<code> if </code> statement - if the accelerometer registers a 'shake' gesture, make something happen.</p>
    <p>Edit you code so that it looks like this:</p>
    <pre>while True:
    if accelerometer.was_gesture('shake'):
        display.show(Image.HEART)
        sleep(1000)
        display.scroll('Hello')</pre>
    <br>
    <p>You will need to <strong>indent</strong> the lines of code that you want to happen when the micro:bit has been shaken.</p>
    <br>
    <img src=".\images\add-accelerometer.gif" alt="animated image showing where to add the new code, as per the instructions above" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p><strong>What kind of gestures would be useful for your security system?</strong></p>
    <p>An example video is show below - the micro:bit is happy when it is<code> 'face up' </code>, then angry when it is anything else!</p>
    <br>
    <video width="600" height="auto" controls>
      <source src=".\images\accelerometer-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Video of working accelerometer alarm. A micro:bit with a happy face on the display is attached to the lid of small box made of Lego. When the lip is flipped open, the micro:bit shows an angry face. The code is shown below the video, as described below.
    </video>
    <br>
    <pre>while True:
    if accelerometer.is_gesture('face up'):
        display.show(Image.HAPPY)
    else:
        display.show(Image.ANGRY)</pre>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="sounds" class="left">
    <h3>Adding an alarm</h3>
    <p>Sound is important to a security system - you can add music, beeps or sound effects as well as changes to the display.</p>
    <p>Have a look through the Sounds section of the Reference menu, there are a few different options you can use.</p>
    <p>Try the 'expressive sounds', which are at the bottom of the menu - you can drag-and-drop this directly into your code, as it is only one line.</p>
    <p>Think about when you want your sound to happen - the micro:bit will do your code <strong>in order</strong> - should it play the sound before or after changing the image?</p>
    <p>Experiment with the music code as well - the editor will automatically add the 'import music' line to the top of your code - you only need this once.</p>

    <h3>Creating a pressure sensor</h3>
    <video width="800" height="auto" controls>
      <source src=".\images\pressure-sensor-jake.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Video of working pressure sensor. An orange is on some white paper. Poking out from under the paper are two pieces of metallic tape, attached to crocodile clips which lead to a micro:bit. When the orange is removed, an alarm sounds.
    </video>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>how it works - break the circuit</p>
    <p>how to connect it - micro:bit connections to the crocodile clips</p>
    <p>how to code it - use correct pin</p>
    <p>test it with two crocodile clips - what happens when they touch, what happens when you disconnect them?</p>
    <p>now create you pressure sensor</p>

    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>We have shown you some ideas of how to create a security system for your picnic, which options do you think would work best?</p>
    <p>Build your security system and test it out on your family - if they manage to steal your picnic, work out how they did it and improve your design.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Some ideas...</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Attach your micro:bit securely to the lid of a box, and work on your accelerometer code.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Experiment with ways to combine both the accelerometer code and the pressure sensor code at the same time! This is a both an engineering and a coding challenge, so think carefully about what you need to do.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you have been to our clubs before, think about other micro:bit features or accessories you have used - could any of them be used to improve your security system?</li>
    </ul>
