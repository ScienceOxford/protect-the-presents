  </header>

  <div id="intro">
    <p>Resources for the 'Picnic Protectors' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will design and code a micro:bit alarm system.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/June22CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#extensions">click here</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="starter" class="left">
    <h3>Python Beta Editor</h3>
    <p>add screen shot of new editor, showing sections</p>
    <p>pair micro:bit with computer, to allow easy flashing</p>
    <img src=".\images\connect-python.gif" alt="animated image showing how to pair your micro:bit with your computer, as per the instructions above" width="800px" height="auto">
    <p>Edit the starter code - make your name show, change the image etc</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="accelerometer" class="left">
    <h3>Using the motion sensor</h3>
    <p>how to find the accelerometer code</p>
    <p>BE CAREFUL - we don't need the whole thing, so if you drag and drop it, you will get some errors (two while True loops)</p>
    <p>how / where to add the accelerometer code, including indentation</p>
    <img src=".\images\add-accelerometer.gif" alt="animated image showing where to add the new code, as per the instructions above" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>add video clip showing box being opened and the micro:bit's gesture being changed</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="sounds" class="left">
    <h3>Adding an alarm</h3>
    <p>how to find the sound code - two different options</p>
    <p>the import goes to the top - you only need this in your code once</p>
    <p>how / where to add the sound code, including indentation options & ordering</p>
    <img src=".\images\add-sounds.gif" alt="animated image showing where to add the new code, as per the instructions above" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>when do you want your alarm to sound? what would make a good security system?</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="pressure" class="left">
    <h3>Creating a pressure sensor</h3>
    <video width="800" height="auto" controls>
      <source src=".\images\pressure-sensor-jake.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Video of working pressure sensor. An orange is on some white paper. Poking out from under the paper are two pieces of metallic tape, attached to crocodile clips which lead to a micro:bit. When the orange is removed, an alarm sounds.
    </video>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>how it works - break the circuit</p>
    <p>how to connect it - micro:bit connections to the crocodile clips</p>
    <p>how to code it - use correct pin</p>
    <p>test it with two crocodile clips - what happens when they touch, what happens when you disconnect them?</p>
    <p>now create you pressure sensor</p>

    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>We have shown you some ideas of how to create a security system for your picnic, which options do you think would work best?</p>
    <p>Build your security system and test it out on your family - if they manage to steal your picnic, work out how they did it and improve your design.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Some ideas...</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Attach your micro:bit securely to the lid of a box, and work on your accelerometer code.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Experiment with ways to combine both the accelerometer code and the pressure sensor code at the same time! This is a both an engineering and a coding challenge, so think carefully about what you need to do.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you have been to our clubs before, think about other micro:bit features or accessories you have used - could any of them be used to improve your security system?</li>
    </ul>
