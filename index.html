  <div id="intro">
    <p>Resources for the 'Picnic Protectors' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will design and code a micro:bit alarm system.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Jun22CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#extensions">click here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Python Beta Editor</h3>
    <p>Open the new Python editor by visiting <a href="https://python.microbit.org/v/beta" target="_blank">python.microbit.org/v/beta</a>. Your screen will look something like this:</p>
    <img src=".\images\python-editor.PNG" alt="screenshot of the Python editor screen" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>On the right-hand-side is where you will add your own code.</li>
      <li>On the left-hand-side is the reference menu - you can see examples of some of the code here, as well as help understanding these examples.</li>
      <li>On the bottom are the Flash (send your code to the micro:bit) and Disconnect buttons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="pairing-python.html" target=_blank>If you see 'Download' and 'Connect' at the bottom of the screen instrad, follow these instructions to pair your micro:bit with your computer.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>Edit the code on the screen, then flash it to your micro:bit to see the changes.</p>
    <p>Try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Editing the image that is shown (hint: check the reference menu, under Display, for a list of images)</li>
        <li>Changing the number in the brackets after sleep (hint: this tells the micro:bit how long to keep your image on the display)</li>
        <li>Making the micro:bit scroll your name instead of 'Hello'</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the motion sensor</h3>
    <p>how to find the accelerometer code</p>
    <p>BE CAREFUL - we don't need the whole thing, so if you drag and drop it, you will get some errors (two while True loops)</p>
    <p>how / where to add the accelerometer code, including indentation</p>

      Video of working pressure sensor. An orange is on some white paper. Poking out from under the paper are two pieces of metallic tape, attached to crocodile clips which lead to a micro:bit. When the orange is removed, an alarm sounds.

  <div id="sounds" class="left">
    <h3>Adding an alarm</h3>
    <p>how to find the sound code - two different options</p>
    <p>the import goes to the top - you only need this in your code once</p>
    <p>how / where to add the sound code, including indentation options & ordering</p>

    <br>
    <p>when do you want your alarm to sound? what would make a good security system?</p>

    <h3>Creating a pressure sensor</h3>

    <br>
    <p>how it works - break the circuit</p>
    <p>how to connect it - micro:bit connections to the crocodile clips</p>
    <p>how to code it - use correct pin</p>
    <p>test it with two crocodile clips - what happens when they touch, what happens when you disconnect them?</p>
    <p>now create you pressure sensor</p>

    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>We have shown you some ideas of how to create a security system for your picnic, which options do you think would work best?</p>
    <p>Build your security system and test it out on your family - if they manage to steal your picnic, work out how they did it and improve your design.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Some ideas...</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Attach your micro:bit securely to the lid of a box, and work on your accelerometer code.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Experiment with ways to combine both the accelerometer code and the pressure sensor code at the same time! This is a both an engineering and a coding challenge, so think carefully about what you need to do.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you have been to our clubs before, think about other micro:bit features or accessories you have used - could any of them be used to improve your security system?</li>
    </ul>
